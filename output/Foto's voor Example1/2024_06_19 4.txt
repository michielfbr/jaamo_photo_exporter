This is a very long description example. Captions may
be well over 120 symbols in Jaamo. While exporting
photo's via this script, short captions will be
added to the photo filename. Longer captions will be
stored in a separate text file, along with the photo.
The first scentence of the long caption will also be
added to the photo filename.
