# Jaamo photo exporter

A script to download all photos from the Jaamo app at once.
Built since Jaamo lacks this functionability, and saving 900+ photos and then adding the date and caption, one by one would be a pain in the \*ss.

The script will iterate through app's html to download every photo and store it, using it's date and description. Longer descriptions will be stored in a separate text file.
